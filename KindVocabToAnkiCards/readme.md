I had a problem where I just couldn't bother manually inputing definitions for all the words I looked up on my Kindle. So, this is the solition.

__This works only for Japanese to English__

### Sources I used
Dictionary json from jmdiict-simplified: https://github.com/scriptin/jmdict-simplified

### How to generate a csv file with words you need
1. Locate vocab.db in your Kindle
2. Run "kidnle_vocab.session.sql" after inputting the title of the book
